## 📖 The Rules of Set

A "Set" consists of **three cards** where each of the four individual features must be **either all the same or all different** across the trio. If even one feature fails this "all same or all different" test, it is not a set.

### The Four Features:

1. **Color:** Red, Green, or Blue.
2. **Shape:** Triangle, Circle, or Square.
3. **Number:** 1, 2, or 3 symbols.
4. **Shading (Fill):** Solid, Striped, or Empty (outline only).

> **Example of a Valid Set:**
> * **Card 1:** Two Red Solid Circles
> * **Card 2:** Two Green Solid Triangles
> * **Card 3:** Two Blue Solid Squares
> 
> 
> *Result: **Valid.** (Number and Shading are all the same; Color and Shape are all different.)*
